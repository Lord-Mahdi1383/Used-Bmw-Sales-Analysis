01. The box plot shows a price distribution between $0 and $60900 meaning most cars are picked in this range
    these are likely family cars or low milage cars
02. The outlier cars are mostly performace models (M series) and some X-series models which are probably
    newer cars with low milages
03. The outlier cars are generally in good condition with an average of 4.4/5.0
04. Outlier cars have an average of 7.5k miles which is relatively low ------> luxury cars like i8
05. Car age and odometer reading have a posotive relationship ------> older cars tend to have higher milages
06. Most cars accumulate over 200k miles within the first 5 years
07. There's little to no increases in odometer reading after year 5
08. There are some cars over 20 years old with extremely low milages (likely collector's editions or classics)
09. There is a strong negetive relationship: as milage increases the selling price decreases
10. Vehicles lose a significant portion of their value within the first 50k miles
11. The price decline slows down after 50k miles
12. Prices approach a floor around 150k miles
13. The most expensive cars are i8s with extremely low milage which makes sense as they are
    premium vehicles with limited production
14. Both mmr and selling price show strong negative relationship with car age
15. 0-2 year old cars show a rapid drop in value
16. 2-4 year-old cars depreciate, but at a slower rate compared to new cars
17. The value of cars older than 10 years stabilizes and doesn't drop significantly further
18. The selling price mirrors the MMR valuation but with more variance
19. The maximum selling price is usually lower than the maximum MMR estimate
20. The price distribution has a peak at lower values, with a long tail of a few luxury cars with high prices
21. Most cars have between 0-60k miles
22. Most cars are between 2-5 years old
23. The condition rating is peaked around 3.7-4.3
24. The majority of sales are in the $20k-$40k range
25. A long tail in the price distribution shows luxury vehicles with price > $75k
26. Both luxury cars (>$75k) and cheaper cars (<$25k) are generally sold for less than their MMR-estimated value
27. Based on price difference, MMR is generally a reliable predictor,
    most cars are sold with 0 price difference but some cars are sold with $5k differnece
28. Automatic transmissions dominate the market (~85%), which aligns with the prevalence of family cars like SUVs
29. Manual transmisiosn are far less common with only 4%
30. Sedan and suv body types are the most common, and wagons are the least common
31. Since most of our vehicles are SUVs that confirm the automatic transmision,
    which is best for a family car
32. Black is the most common exterior color, followed equally by gray and white
33. Colors like yellow, pink, turquoise and some other are the least common likely because they are
    custom made from the factory for that particular buyer
34. Black interior is the most common by far, with over 10k vehicles
35. Interior colors like green, gold, purple, and blue are the least common, probably because they are
    less versatile and don't match most ecterior colors
36. Bmw i8 sold only 8 units but at a very high average price, confirming its status a luxury or collector car
37. M6 and 6 series Gran Coupe sold almost 200 units combined at a similarly high average price
38. Bmw X4 sold only 5 untis with a low average price, likely becuase competitors like the X3 and X5
    series offer better value
39. Automatic transmisions have a higher average price becuase they're a more expensive option
40. Manual transmision are basically the budget build
41. 3 series is top selling bmw model 8142 vehicle sold (~ 40%)
42. Models like 320i and 323i have lower sales potentially do to being unreliable or
    having lower values per dollar spent
43. M series cars have lower total sales because they're more expensive
44. Niche vehicles like 'Gran Coupes', 'Gran Turismo' or 'ActiveHybrid' have extremely
    low sales volume which is expected for a specialized car
45. The M3 was the best selling M-powered vehicle with nearly 300 sales
46. The 3 series generated over $137M in revenue which is expected given its high sales volume
47. Bmw X5 is the leading SUV in terms of revenue generating $88M
48. The 5 series generated significantly more total revenue than the 2 best selling SUVs (X5 and X3) combined
49. The 3 series and 5 series is dominating the market with its total sale and low price average
    offering a combination of affordability and brand appeal
50. X5 comes after 3 series and 5 series which makes it a good family car with its low price average
51. The i8 has a very high average price but low revenue meaning very few were sold
52. The reason M4 had really low sales (compared to other M-powered cars) was because of high average price
53. Even though ActiveHybrid vehicles have relatively low average price, they still sold in low volume
54. Most sales occur at night (1AM - 4AM)
55. There are some sales during work hours (12PM - 2PM) likely during lunch breaks
56. There are no sales after work hours (6PM)
57. Over 90% of car sales happen in the AM half of the day, primarily at night
58. Most sales happen in the middle of the week rather than on weekends.
59. Most sales occur in the first two months of the year (Jan and Feb).
60. Sales drop slightly in springs
62. There are almost no sales in summer
62. Sales start to pick up again at the end of the year (Dec)
63. Odometer and car age are highly related (+0.81) which means older cars tend to have higher milages
64. Year is highly related to mmr and selling price (+0.8) followed by condition and odometer
65. Odometer has a better realtionship with mmr and selling price than condition, which means buyers prefer
    to buy cars with lower milages rather than higher condition
66. Features like color, interior color, transmission, and body type show little to no linear correlation
    with other numerical features
67. MMR and selling price are strongly positively correlated, almost linearly
68. Both odometer and car age are negatively correlated with MMR and selling price
69. Certain body types are associated with clusters of higher-priced cars
70. The distribution of odometer readings is strongly right-skewed: many vehicles have low mileage,
    with a long tail of vehicles extending to very high milages

CONCLUSION AND INSIGHT FOR A CAR SALES WEBSITE:

1. Prioritize the Core Audience: The vast majority of our buyers are seeking value-oriented, family-friendly vehicles. Our website's homepage, search defaults, and promoted inventory should prominently feature 3 Series, 5 Series, and X5 models priced between $20k-$40k with automatic transmissions and under 60k miles. This is our volume engine.

2. High-End Models Section: While fewer in number, buyers of high-end models (M Series, i8) are highly active. They shop for low-mileage (<10k), newer vehicles in excellent condition. We should create a dedicated, premium section of the website for these "Luxury & Performance" models. This enhances the experience for these high-value buyers without complicating the journey for our core audience.

3. Optimize for When Customers Shop: Sales activity is not evenly distributed.

    -Timing: Launch major marketing campaigns and ensure ad budgets are highest in Q1 (Jan-Feb) and Q4 (Dec) and
     consider smaller push in springs

    -Day & Time: Since most sales happen mid-week and very late at night (1-4 AM), ensure your website support and
     live chat functions are available during these peak hours
